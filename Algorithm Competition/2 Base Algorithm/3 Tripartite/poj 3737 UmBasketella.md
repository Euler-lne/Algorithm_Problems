# Description

In recent days, people always design new things with multifunction. For instance, you can not only use cell phone to call your friends, but you can also use your cell phone take photographs or listen to MP3. Another example is the combination between watch and television. These kinds of multifunction items can always improve people's daily life and are extremely favored by users.

The company Mr. Umbrella invented a new kind umbrella "UmBasketella" for people in Rainbow city recently and its idea also comes from such multifunction--the combination of umbrella and daily necessities. This kind of umbrella can be used as a basket and you can put something you want to carry in it. Since Rainbow city rains very often, such innovative usage is successful and "UmBasketella" sells very well. Unfortunately, the original "UmBasketella" do not have an automatic volume control technology so that it is easily damaged when users try to put too many things in it. To solve this problem, you are needed to design an "UmBasketella" with maximum volume. Suppose that "UmBasketella" is a cone-shape container and its surface area (include the bottom) is known, could you find the maximum value of the cone?

雨伞先生公司最近为彩虹城的人们发明了一种新型雨伞 “UmBasketella”, 它的创意也源于这种多功能性 —— 雨伞和日用品的结合。这种雨伞可以用作篮子，你可以把想带的东西放在里面。由于彩虹城经常下雨，这种创新的使用很成功，“UmBasketella” 卖得很好。不幸的是，最初的 “UmBasketella” 没有自动容量控制技术，所以当用户试图往里面放太多东西时，它很容易损坏。为了解决这个问题，你需要设计一个容量最大的 “UmBasketella”。假设 “UmBasketella” 是一个圆锥形容器，它的表面积 (包括底部) 已知，你能找到圆锥体的最大值吗？

# Input

Input contains several test cases. Eash case contains only one real number S, representing the surface area of the cone. It is guaranteed that 1≤S≤10000.

输入包含多个测试用例。Eash 用例只包含一个实数 S, 表示锥体的表面积。保证 1≤S≤10000。

# Output

For each test case, output should contain three lines.
The first line should have a real number representing the maximum volume of the cone.
Output the height of the cone on the second line and the radius of the bottom area of the cone on the third line.
All real numbers should rounded to 0.01.

对于每个测试用例，输出应包含三行。
第一行应包含一个表示圆锥体最大体积的实数。
输出第二行的圆锥体高度和第三行的圆锥体底部面积半径。
所有实数都应舍入到 0.01。
